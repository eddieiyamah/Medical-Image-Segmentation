# Medical Image Segmentation
Developed a system to automatically identify tumours in MRI images using an encoder-decoder deep learning framework, specifically U-NET, coupled with the Adam optimiser. Enhanced the system's efficiency by converting the model into a TFLite version, significantly decreasing latency.
